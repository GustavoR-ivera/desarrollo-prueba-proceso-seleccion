#Gustavo Rivera - Proyect development

**General considerations about software development**

1. Analysis
  -understand the business context
  -abstraction process
  -functional requirements:
    -use cases, services to offer.
  -non functional requirements (*quiality attributes*):
    -performance, response times, scalability, work loads, deployment, security.

2. Design
  -software architecture: based on the previous requirements.
    -layered, mvc, mpc, microservices, event oriented, hexagonal, microkernel, etc...
  -specify and design a database:
    -aspects to consider: read/write operations, the structure of the data, the data types, etc...
    -for example, in a sql db we have entities, relationships, e-r & relation models.
  -design an api 
    -define the specification of the api alinged with the functional requirements
    -define input parameters as well as outputs 
  -for each aspect we can define a set of technologies to be used.
**at the end of this step we have a general view of the system structure**

4. Development & Testing
  -get the licenses for the respective services
  -get training for the development team
  -choose work methodology and tools for workflow
    -jira, trello, slack, teams.
    -for example in scrum:
      -define product backlog, refine sprint backlog, schedule sprints, do retrospective etc...

5. Implementation/deploy
